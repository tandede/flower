# Chat in your browser

Use the browser to get your first Flower Agent response. You don't need to
install Flower or provide a model API key.

```{note}
The browser interface is experimental and may change between releases.
```

## Before you start

Confirm that you have:

- a Flower account with Flower Agent access;
- access to the email or identity provider used to sign in;
- a current desktop browser; and
- a reliable network connection.

If you plan to use Slack, Notion, GitHub, or Attio later, make sure you can
authorize the relevant account. Account connectors work only in your personal
Flower workspace, and you won't need one for this quickstart.

## Open Flower Agent

Go to [flower.ai/app](https://flower.ai/app), select **Sign in**, and complete
the authentication flow. When you return, you should see **New chat**, a prompt
field, and an agent selector.

The federation shown in the page header or breadcrumb is where this
conversation's runs will execute.

A new browser chat starts with **Flower Agent** selected. The connector control
is beside the agent selector.
```

## Choose an agent

Keep **Flower Agent** selected for the first run. If the selector is empty or
still loading after a refresh, see [Troubleshoot AgentApp
runs](../how-to-guides/troubleshoot-agent-runs.md).

The agent selector lists the agents available for the current execution
workspace.
```

Leave account connectors unselected for now. You can add them after the first
run works.

## Send a deterministic prompt

Enter:

```text
Reply with exactly: Flower Agent is ready.
```

Submit the prompt and wait for the run to finish.

```{admonition} Success checkpoint
:class: tip

You should see your prompt and a completed response in the same conversation.
The exact wording may differ, but the run should start, show output, and finish
without an error.
```

## Check conversation context

In the same conversation, ask:

```text
What exact phrase did I ask you to return?
```

The default Flower Agent includes earlier messages from the run series, so it
should remember the phrase. Custom AgentApps need to replay stored messages
themselves.

```{figure} ../_static/screenshots/browser-conversation-context.png
:alt: Flower Agent conversation showing the initial response, a context-dependent follow-up, and a completed run.

The follow-up uses the earlier turn, and the conversation shows the run as
completed.
```

Select **New chat** before starting an unrelated task.

## What happened

Each submitted message starts one **run** of the selected **AgentApp**. Flower
groups related runs in a **run series**, which the browser presents as a
conversation. The run series belongs to a **federation**. The runtime gives the
AgentApp an `AgentSession` for model and connector calls and a `Context` for run
configuration and state.

See [Use agents and
federations](../how-to-guides/use-agents-and-federations.md) to learn how these
pieces fit together.

## If the checkpoint fails

If it fails, try these steps in order:

1. Confirm that you are signed in and have Flower Agent access.
1. Refresh the browser.
1. Start a new chat and retry the deterministic prompt once.
1. Record the visible error, time, app spec, and federation name.
1. Follow [Troubleshoot AgentApp
   runs](../how-to-guides/troubleshoot-agent-runs.md).

Never include access tokens, OAuth callback URLs, connector credentials, or
private source content in a support report.

## Next steps

- Prefer a terminal workflow? [Chat in your
  terminal](get-started-with-flower-agent.md) introduces `flwr chat`.
- [Write your first AgentApp](write-your-first-agentapp.md).
- [Build a collaborative research agent](build-a-collaborative-agent.md).
- [Connect accounts](../how-to-guides/connect-accounts.md) only if your project
  needs account data.
