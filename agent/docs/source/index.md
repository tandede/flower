# Flower Agent

Flower Agent lets you build and run agentic applications on Flower. An
`AgentApp` contains your agent logic, while Flower supplies model access,
connectors, run state, and a runtime that can execute the app locally or on
SuperGrid.

## Choose how to start

Start with whichever interface you prefer:

- [Chat in your browser](tutorials/quickstart.md) gets you to a first response
  without a local installation or model API key.
- [Chat in your
  terminal](tutorials/get-started-with-flower-agent.md) introduces the `flwr chat` terminal interface.

When you're ready to build:

- [Write your first AgentApp](tutorials/write-your-first-agentapp.md) builds the
  smallest useful custom app.
- [Build a collaborative research
  agent](tutorials/build-a-collaborative-agent.md) adds conversation context,
  multiple connector calls, and a bounded tool loop.

```{note}
Flower Agent is experimental. Its interfaces and behavior may change between
releases.
```

## Understand the pieces

- An **AgentApp** is packaged agent logic that Flower can execute.
- An **agent** is an AgentApp made available for selection by an app spec such
  as `@flwrlabs/flwr-agent` or by a specific Flower App Bundle (FAB).
- A **run** is one execution. Related runs can share a **run series**, which the
  chat interfaces present as a conversation.
- A **federation** is the SuperGrid workspace in which runs execute and are
  visible.
- A **connector** gives an AgentApp a runtime-provided tool. Some connectors are
  built in; account connectors use access granted by the signed-in user.

Read [Use agents and federations](how-to-guides/use-agents-and-federations.md)
to see how these pieces fit together and how to select agents and federations.

## Documentation boundaries

This site contains Flower Agent tutorials, guides, concepts, and operational
documentation. The generated [`flwr.agentapp` Python API
reference](https://flower.ai/docs/framework/ref-api/flwr.agentapp.html) remains
in the Flower framework documentation.

Design proposals and partially implemented paths aren't documented as current
capabilities. Persistent federation Agent management, persistent CLI
conversation history, and a public Open Responses-compatible runtime endpoint
aren't available yet.
